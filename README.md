## 🛠 How Intelli Learn Works

1. **User enters a math word problem**
2. **AI parses the problem** and identifies relevant concepts
3. **Visual explanation is generated**
4. User can:

   * Study the explanation
   * Practice with adaptive quizzes
5. The app reinforces learning with **clear visual logic**
